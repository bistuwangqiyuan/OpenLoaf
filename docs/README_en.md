## 🧐 About

OpenLoaf is a modern, full-stack AI knowledge base and smart workspace application. It combines **Notion**-style hierarchical document management with **ChatGPT/Claude**-level AI conversation, creating a second brain that doesn't just chat — it retains knowledge.

Everything in OpenLoaf is organized around **Projects**. Each project is a self-contained folder — documents, conversations, files, tasks, and AI context all live together in one place. Switch between projects seamlessly, and AI always knows exactly which project you're working on.

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AI Agents

More than a chatbot — OpenLoaf's AI can **actually get things done**. Built-in system agents include a Document Assistant, Terminal Assistant, Browser Assistant, Email Assistant, Calendar Assistant, and more. The AI understands your intent, breaks down tasks, chains tools together, and collaborates across agents to complete multi-step workflows autonomously. Just give the command — AI handles the rest.

  <br />
  <sub>AI automatically invokes the Terminal Assistant to organize files, then reports back</sub>
</div>

### 💬 AI Chat

Built-in multi-model AI chat supporting **OpenAI**, **Anthropic Claude**, **Google Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, **Qwen**, **xAI Grok**, and local models via **Ollama**. The AI is aware of your full project context — file structure, document content, conversation history — truly understanding your project. Supports file attachments, web search, custom system prompts, and one-click model switching to compare answer quality.

### 🎨 Infinite Canvas (Board)

A ReactFlow-powered infinite canvas — not just a whiteboard, but your **visual thinking space**. Supports free-form drag-and-drop layouts, sticky notes, image/video nodes, freehand drawing, AI image generation (text-to-image), AI video generation, and image content understanding. Mind maps, flowcharts, and inspiration walls can all coexist on a single canvas.

### 🖼️ AI Image & Video Generation

Turn ideas into visuals instantly. OpenLoaf integrates AI-powered **text-to-image generation** and **AI video generation** directly into the canvas and chat. Generate illustrations, concept art, or marketing visuals from text prompts, then drag them onto your canvas for further editing. AI can also **understand image content** — describe what's in a photo, extract text, or answer questions about visual materials. All generation happens through your own API keys — no third-party services store your creative output.

### 📝 Rich Text Editor

A powerful block-based editor built on [Plate.js](https://platejs.org/). Supports headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, LaTeX formulas, tables, media embeds, bi-directional links, and more. A WYSIWYG editing experience with a rich toolbar and keyboard shortcuts makes writing and organizing documents effortless. Freely structure your notes, project docs, and research materials through infinitely nested pages.

### 📋 Kanban Task Management

A Trello-style board view managing the full task lifecycle through **📥 To Do → 🔄 In Progress → 👀 Review → ✅ Done** columns. Supports drag-and-drop sorting, priority labels (🔴 Urgent / 🟠 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low), trigger modes (manual / scheduled / conditional), and due date reminders. AI can automatically create tasks and submit them for review — just approve or send back with one click, and let AI do the work for you.

### 🧰 All-in-One Productivity Suite

No more switching between apps — everything you need is built in:

- 🖥️ **Terminal** — A full shell emulator right inside OpenLoaf. AI agents can run commands directly — create directories, move files, execute scripts — with natural language instructions, always confirming before execution.
- 📧 **Email** — Multi-account email management with IMAP sync, rich-text composing, and AI-assisted drafting, summarization, and key info extraction.
- 📅 **Calendar** — Schedule management with **native system calendar sync** (macOS Calendar / Google Calendar). Day / week / month views, AI-powered scheduling, and smart reminders.
- 📂 **File Manager** — Grid / list / column views, drag-and-drop upload, file preview (images, PDFs, Office docs, code). AI can read and operate on your project files directly.
- 🧩 **Workspace Widgets** — Customizable dashboard with clock, calendar, task summary, quick actions, and agent settings — your mission control at a glance.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 📚 **Research & Writing** — Collect references, take structured notes, chat with AI about your materials, and produce polished documents — all within one project folder.
- 💻 **Software Development** — Manage specs and design docs, use AI to generate code snippets, run commands in the terminal, and track tasks on the kanban board.
- 🎨 **Creative Design** — Brainstorm on the infinite canvas, generate images and videos with AI, organize visual assets in the file manager, and iterate with AI feedback.
- 📊 **Project Management** — Create a project per client or initiative, manage tasks through the kanban workflow, schedule meetings on the calendar, and coordinate via email — without leaving OpenLoaf.
- 🧠 **Personal Knowledge Base** — Build your second brain: clip web content, write journals, link ideas with bi-directional references, and let AI help you connect the dots across your knowledge.

## 💡 Why OpenLoaf

The AI era is here, but collaborating with AI in our daily work is still full of friction and fragmentation.

### 😤 Pain Points with Existing Tools

**🔒 Closed Source + No Data Control** — Mainstream knowledge bases like Notion are closed-source. Your documents, notes, and data all live on their servers. You can't choose your own AI model, and you have no control over where your data goes.

**⚙️ Open-Source Alternatives Are Too Complex** — Open-source alternatives like OpenClaw exist, but they're complex to configure and have unfriendly interfaces, creating a high barrier for non-technical users.

**🔀 Fragmented AI Workflows** — One task, four or five windows, constant copy-pasting. AI is powerful, but the workflow is shattered across tools.

**🔄 Re-feeding Context Every Single Conversation** — Real work is **project-based**. AI should always understand the full context of your current project.

### 🎯 How OpenLoaf Solves This

- **📦 Zero-Config, Ready to Go** — Download the installer, double-click, done. No servers, databases, or Docker to configure.
- **🧠 Project-Centric, AI Understands Context Natively** — Each project is a self-contained space. AI is always aware of your full project context, with built-in memory.
- **🔗 Unified Multi-Modal Workflow** — Text, images, video, code, terminal, email, calendar — all capabilities live in one app, orchestrated by one AI.
- **🔓 Open Source + Local First** — Fully open-source code, 100% local data storage, use any AI model you want.
- **🧩 Customizable Widget Workspace** — Different projects can have different widgets. In the future, build your own tools right inside OpenLoaf with AI.

### 🛋️ Loaf = Bread + Slacking Off

The OpenLoaf logo is a bread-shaped sofa. **Loaf** means both "a loaf of bread" and "to loaf around." Our goal is to help you **slack off efficiently** — let AI handle the tedious, repetitive work while you sit back and focus on the decisions that actually matter. 🍞

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

OpenLoaf is built with a **local-first, privacy-by-design** philosophy. Your data stays on your device — always.

- 💾 **100% Local Storage** — All documents, conversations, files, and databases are stored on your local filesystem (`~/.openloaf/`). Nothing is uploaded to any cloud server.
- 🔑 **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** — You connect your own API keys for AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.). OpenLoaf never proxies your requests through a third-party server — API calls go directly from your machine to the model provider.
- 📴 **Offline-Capable** — Core features (editor, file manager, task board) work fully offline. Connect local models via Ollama for a completely air-gapped AI experience.
- 🚫 **No Telemetry, No Tracking** — OpenLoaf does not collect analytics, usage data, or any form of telemetry. What happens on your machine stays on your machine.
- 🔍 **Open Source & Auditable** — The entire codebase is open under AGPLv3. You can inspect, audit, and verify every line of code that touches your data.

> **TL;DR** — Unlike cloud-based AI tools, OpenLoaf ensures your intellectual property, API keys, and personal data never leave your control.
